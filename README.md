Pi is a awesome irrational number. It never ends. It has many decimal digits, so diverse that your phone number may be present.


However, this project is a simple project on Estimating pi.

Take a number(really big)

Say, 41354 (COnsider this number n)

Now do the following maths(remember, sin is in degrees)
n * sin(180/n)

that is, 

41354 * sin(180/41354)
= 3.1415926505680103

which is close to pi.

Basically, this method outputs values approaching pi.
In a mathematical sense though, we call that the value is limited to pi.

In app.py file, I mentioned everything.

I hope you liked this project. BTW, I made it on Pi day.
